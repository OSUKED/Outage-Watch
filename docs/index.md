We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have we have been checking the overhead line network but have not located the fault and we now expect your supply to be restored by 5pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6:11am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a fault on our underground cable network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6pm. We will update this message if this information changes.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 11.09am.  In order to complete repairs, engineers on site needed to isolate the power to other properties and we expect the power to be restored by 8.00pm.
