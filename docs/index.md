We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12:09pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still investigating an underground cable fault affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 7:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
