This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will need to close the road on the day however access will always be provided. This work is taking place on Church Lane and Lewes Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                               |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will be using 2 way traffic management on the day. This work is taking place on Sunny Avenue. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                      |
