Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and we will also send our next available engineer to attend site. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2:15pm. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6:11am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a fault on our underground cable network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
