We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have established there is an underground cable fault in the area, generators have been arranged however due to onsite difficulties we now expect your supply to be restored by 8.30pm. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

Our engineers turned off the power to 10 properties in stages between 08:09 and 08:23 to allow them safely replace some overhead electricity poles and the replacement of the transformer that feeds power into your area. They have advised us that the works have progressed well and as a result will be restored early at approx. 15:15 to all 10 properties. Now these works have been completed this will improve the reliability of the electricity network whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-229454-Z.  We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you. As we aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel there is more we could have done for your situation or if you have any questions then please call 105. Thank you. |
