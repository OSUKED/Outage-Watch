We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12.06AM. Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and our emergency response team are on their way to site to investigate and repair the fault. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2.15AM. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of this at 7:54PM. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a snapped pole which is resulting in overhead cables hanging low which is affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2AM. If this information changes then we will make every effort to contact you. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
