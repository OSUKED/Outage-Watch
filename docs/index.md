We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 5.10pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to restore supplies following extensive damage to the Sinclair Street substation affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2.00am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

Our engineers turned off the power to 10 properties in stages between 08:09 and 08:23 to allow them safely replace some overhead electricity poles and the replacement of the transformer that feeds power into your area. They have advised us that the works have progressed well and as a result will be restored early at approx. 15:15 to all 10 properties. Now these works have been completed this will improve the reliability of the electricity network whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-229454-Z.  We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you. As we aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel there is more we could have done for your situation or if you have any questions then please call 105. Thank you. |
