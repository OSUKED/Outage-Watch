It will be necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 10.30AM due to necessary repairs to the electrical cable network. Our team will be carrying out repair work safely on the overhead network and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 11.30AM. We will update this message if this information changes.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 7:24AM.  In order to complete repairs, engineers on site will need to isolate the power to other properties and we expect the power to be restored by 12:30PM.
