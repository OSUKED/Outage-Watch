We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 10:05PM . Our engineers are on their way to the local substation to investigate and repair the fault and our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible. We expect the power to be restored by 1:15AM. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 10:32PM on 23rd April 2021.                                                    |

Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of broken equipment on the overhead line network. Our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 02:00AM.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 4:35pm. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to complete a repair to an underground cable between Niddrie Main Drive, Wauchope Terrace and Harewood Crescent affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. This work is taking place on Trottiscliffe Road.
