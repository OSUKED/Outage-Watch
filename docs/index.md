The works are a result of investigations we had conducted following residents concerns over lower than normal voltage in the area. The transformer controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure the quality of supply in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in the Tompsets Bank and Balfour Gardens area. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. |
