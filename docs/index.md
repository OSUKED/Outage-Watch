We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 10:25am. Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and we will also send our next available engineer to attend site. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12:30pm. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

It has been necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 10:00am due to emergency tree cutting in the Whistleberry area and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes.

This work is following on from a customers request and due to the type of overhead electricity cables we need to make the connection to, engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power to ensure they can carry out this work safely. This work will ensure that our electricity network can uphold the electricity usage in your area whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in Ashford Road, Chilham. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. |
