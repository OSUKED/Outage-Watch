We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12:09pm. Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and our emergency response team are on their way to site to investigate and repair the fault. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2:15pm.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6:11am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a fault on our underground cable network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

Our team will be carrying out repair work safely on the underground cable network and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible in stages, with some customers restored by 2.30pm and the remainder by 4.00pm .
