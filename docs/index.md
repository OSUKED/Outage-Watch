This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place off Rye Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                                                                              |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. This work is taking place on Trottiscliffe Road. Please note that we will be using two way traffic management on the day of the planned power cut. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                          |
