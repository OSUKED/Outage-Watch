It is necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 11am to conduct repairs to a damaged underground cable and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 10pm. We will update this message if this information changes.

We did not know in advance there would be a power cut however our engineers have now arrived on site and in order to repair a fault on our overhead line network, we now need to carry out an emergency shutdown at 11:30am. This may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12:30pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

This propertys Cut-Out needs replacing due to potential safety concerns. When we identify properties with this issue we often identify further properties requiring the same works to be completed. Therefore we would like to access your property during the power cut to inspect the equipment within your property and to replace if necessary. Once the inspections and replacements have been completed this will ensure that all properties are safely connected to our electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Buxton Crescent and Carlton Crescent. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category |
