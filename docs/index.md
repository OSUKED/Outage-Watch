We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12.46pm. Our engineers are on site and confirmed the power cut has been caused by a 3rd party damage to our cable network. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4.30pm. We will update this message if this information changes.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 10:37am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of additional engineers required to assist with investigations and repairs to a fault on our underground cable network and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will be using 2 way traffic management on the day. This work is taking place on London Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 8.55am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of a fault on our underground cable network and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6.00pm.

Our engineers turned off the power to 10 properties in stages between 08:09 and 08:23 to allow them safely replace some overhead electricity poles and the replacement of the transformer that feeds power into your area. They have advised us that the works have progressed well and as a result will be restored early at approx. 15:15 to all 10 properties. Now these works have been completed this will improve the reliability of the electricity network whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-229454-Z.  We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you. As we aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel there is more we could have done for your situation or if you have any questions then please call 105. Thank you. |
