Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and our emergency response team are on their way to the area to investigate the cause of the fault. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 7.30PM. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware at 1:46PM. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of work required and an additional fault found on site and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 7:30PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
