This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Chatfield Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                      |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will be using 2 way traffic management on the day. This work is taking place on London Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.  |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will need to close the road on the day however access will always be provided. This work is taking place on Church Lane and Lewes Road.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will be using 2 way traffic management on the day. This work is taking place on Sunny Avenue. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. |

We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and became aware of this at 00:47AM. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of an underground cable fault near to Fairyburn substation and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 10AM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and became aware of this at 11:57PM. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of an underground cable fault and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 11:30AM.

Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working on the grounded overhead cable affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 7AM. If this information changes then we will make every effort to contact you. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
