This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. In order to connect and disconnect the generator we will need to temporarily switch off your power. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator as soon as possible so your power may come on sooner.                                 |

When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This work is taking place at a property on Bowerland Lane.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.
