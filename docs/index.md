Our engineers are on their way to site to investigate and our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6:15pm. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

Along with replacing and upgrading an overhead electricity cable with an improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Partridge Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                  |

When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. This work is taking place at a property on Mill Lane in Ashford. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.   |
