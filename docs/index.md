It will be necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 1.15pm due to broken overhead line equipment. Our team will be carrying out repair work safely on the overhead cable network and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 3.15pm. We will update this message if this information changes.

They will also be replacing and upgrading an overhead electricity cable with an improved insulated cable. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 09:30 and back on at 15:30, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Limes Lane. |

To enable us to work close to our overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to switch off your power.
