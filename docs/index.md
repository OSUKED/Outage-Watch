We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12.46pm. Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and we will also send our next available engineer to attend site. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 3.00pm. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 10:47am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of faulty equipment on our overhead line network near West Mill Road and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will need to close the road on the day however access will always be provided. This work is taking place on Church Lane and Lewes Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                               |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note that we will be using 2 way traffic management on the day. This work is taking place on London Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                       |

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 8.55am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of a fault on our underground cable network and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6.00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
