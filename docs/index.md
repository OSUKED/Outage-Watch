The works are a result of investigations we had conducted following residents concerns over lower than normal voltage in the area. The transformer controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure the quality of supply in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in the Tompsets Bank and Balfour Gardens area. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut.

They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place outside numbers 29 up to 48 on Green Court Road.

When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This work is taking place on Spithurst Road.

While the power is switched off our engineers are going to take the opportunity to replace two high voltage electricity poles that have come to end of their serviceable lives. Doing this work at the same time will hopefully minimise any disruption in the future, improve the reliability of the electricity network along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why its important to complete this work durimng the coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place at a site off Newick Hill and Fletching Mill.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 08:45AM. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the extent of the overhead line repairs and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 4PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place in and around Appledore Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place outside Thompsons Gareden Centre, Pengarth, Pear Tree Farm and Chequers Inn on Stone Street. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                        |
