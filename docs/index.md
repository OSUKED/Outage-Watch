We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 7.56pm. We are aware of the previous power cuts affecting your area and we apologise for this. Our engineers are on their way to the Willow Drive substation to investigate a suspected blown fuse. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 11pm. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at  6:07PM. Our engineers have arrived on site and confirmed the power cut has been caused by a fault on the electrical cable network. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible. We expect the power to be restored by 9:15PM. We will update this message if this information changes.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 5:54pm. Our team have inspected the Bog Road substation and have established an underground cable fault. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the work and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by midnight. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

This propertys Cut-Out needs replacing due to potential safety concerns. When we identify properties with this issue we often identify further properties requiring the same works to be completed. Therefore we would like to access your property during the power cut to inspect the equipment within your property and to replace if necessary. Once the inspections and replacements have been completed this will ensure that all properties are safely connected to our electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Buxton Crescent and Carlton Crescent. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category |
