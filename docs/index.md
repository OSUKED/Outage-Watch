We did not know in advance there would be a power cut however our engineers have now arrived on site and in order to complete the repairs on an underground cable fault outside 70 Harris Drive and to allow for further safe digging, we now need to carry out an emergency shutdown at 8.30pm. This may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 11.00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was recorded at 7.56PM on 25 April 2021.                    |
