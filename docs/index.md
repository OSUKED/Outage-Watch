This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. As the checks are manual we aim to turn the power off at 09:30 and back on at 15:30, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. Please ensure access to the meter is clear.This work is taking place outside numbers 1 to 4 Upper Horton Farm Cottages, New House Lane. |

It will be necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 6:00PM due to emergency repairs required to the underground cable network. Our team will be carrying out repair work safely on the underground cable network and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 8:30PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place in and around Fontridge Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
