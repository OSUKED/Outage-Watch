This work is following on from a customers request and due to the type of underground electricity cables we need to make the connection to, engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power to ensure they can carry out this work safely. Due to 138 properties being affected our engineers have worked to reduce the time to complete the works as much as possible. If they can restore your power sooner, they will certainly do so. This work will ensure that our electricity network can uphold the electricity usage in your area whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This work is taking place at our substation on Lowell Street. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.         |
