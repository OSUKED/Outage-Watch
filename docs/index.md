We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 07.52am. Our engineers are on their way to the local area to investigate a possible blown fuse at the local substation and our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible. We expect the power to be restored by 11.30am. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12:46am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to install generators affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by Midday. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
