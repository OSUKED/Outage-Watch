We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 5:17am. Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and we will also send our next available engineer to attend site. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 7:30am. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have started excavation work on the underground cable fault in the area but due to difficult digging condition and we now expect your supply to be restored by 6:15am. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
