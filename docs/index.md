This item has been identified as the underlying reason for an unplanned power cut on 19th April that affected 172 properties in your area. In order to repair the equipment safely our engineers need to switch off your power. We always aim to give as much notice as possible, however due to the risk to power supplies in the area we have taken the careful and considered decision to ensure we complete this work as soon as possible. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. Once completed this will ensure our electricity network is running to the best of its ability whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This work is taking place on Springfield Farm. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                    |

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6:20am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the complexity of the repairs and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12:00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 05.08am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of a fault on our underground cable network and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 3.00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 10:00 and back on at 16:00, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Holmesdale Hill.                                         |
