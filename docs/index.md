It has been necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 1:30pm to safely carry out repairs to a broken overhead line equipment near Balshaloch farm  and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 3:30pm. We will update this message if this information changes.
