Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the repairs required to a grounded overhead cable and our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 2:00AM.

While the power is switched off our engineers are going to take the opportunity to replace two high voltage electricity poles that have come to end of their serviceable lives. Doing this work at the same time will hopefully minimise any disruption in the future and also improve the reliability of the electricity network. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 30 minutes so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place at a site off Newick Hill and Fletching Mill.
