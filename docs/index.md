This work is following on from a customers request and due to the type of overhead electricity cables we need to make the connection to, engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power to ensure they can carry out this work safely. This work will ensure that our electricity network can uphold the electricity usage in your area whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in Ashford Road, Chilham. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. |
