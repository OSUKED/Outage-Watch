This work is following on from a customers request and due to the type of underground electricity cables we need to make the connection to, engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power to ensure they can carry out this work safely. Due to 138 properties being affected our engineers have worked to reduce the time to complete the works as much as possible. If they can restore your power sooner, they will certainly do so. This work will ensure that our electricity network can uphold the electricity usage in your area whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This work is taking place at our substation on Lowell Street. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                       |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place in and around Hampton Lane, Ashford, Kent. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.

The reason this is being removed is due to it being redundant and this has the potential risk of leaking oil. With the risk of the transformer leaking oil and causing an environmental hazard, our engineers need to complete this work as soon as possible and this is the reason why this work needs to take place during the coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place at Hooe Water Works. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. In order to connect and disconnect the generator we will need to temporarily switch off your power. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator as soon as possible so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place on farmland south of High Halden Road in Biddenden.<br>The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. |

They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors erecting the new poles prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note a road closure will be in place on the day of the works. This work is taking place within Barfreston from Church Farm up to Cannon Cottage. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                  |
