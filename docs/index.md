This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Kithurst Lane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors erecting the new electricity poles prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. This work is taking place outside 87 The Quarries up to 45 The Quarries.

This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors erecting the new poles prior to the outage to the allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 09:30 and back on at 15:30, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. This work is taking place outside Messines to outside Marne on Upper Road. |

This work is following on from a customer's request and to ensure engineers can carry out this work safely will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work will ensure the electricity network can uphold the amount of electricity required for the area. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 15 minutes so your power may come on sooner.
