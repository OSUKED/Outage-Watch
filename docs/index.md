It will be necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 8:30PM to remove generators and finalise repairs on the overhead line network . Our team will be carrying out repair work safely and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 10PM. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

They will also be replacing and upgrading overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Valley Road. Please note that there will be two way traffic lights used to complete the work safely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They will also be replacing and upgrading an overhead electricity cable with an improved insulated cable. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 09:30 and back on at 15:30, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Limes Lane. |
