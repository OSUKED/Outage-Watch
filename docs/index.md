We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6:25pm. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of an underground cable fault near to Clarkston Road and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 3:30am. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience. This message was updated at 9:16PM on Friday 16 April 2021. |
