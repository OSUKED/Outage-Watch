We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 4:34pm. Our team attended the Broomhall Avenue substation and replaced a blown fuse however they have now established an underground cable fault nearby and we now expect to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by midnight. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
