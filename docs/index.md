We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 08.27am. Our control centre will attempt to reset the network remotely to restore power in stages, and we will also send our next available engineer to attend site. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 10.30am. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 5:28am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of ongoing investigation to locate and repair a fault on our underground cable network and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by Midday. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
