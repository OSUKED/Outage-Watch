We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 12.23pm. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of third-party damage to our underground cable network and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 9.00pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 10:00 and back on at 16:00, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Holmesdale Hill.                                         |

This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area, by strengthening this it should prevent unplanned power cuts. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network and ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works.

This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in Biddenden Road.

Once completed this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place in and around Pett Lane, Deans Bottom. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.

You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut.

This item has been identified as the underlying reason for an unplanned power cut on 19th April that affected 172 properties in your area. In order to repair the equipment safely our engineers need to switch off your power. We always aim to give as much notice as possible, however due to the risk to power supplies in the area we have taken the careful and considered decision to ensure we complete this work as soon as possible. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. Once completed this will ensure our electricity network is running to the best of its ability whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This work is taking place on Springfield Farm. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                    |
