This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Tenterden Road.

While the power is switched off our engineers are going to take the opportunity to replace two high voltage electricity poles that have come to end of their serviceable lives. Doing this work at the same time will hopefully minimise any disruption in the future and also improve the reliability of the electricity network. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 30 minutes so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place at a site off Newick Hill and Fletching Mill.

Along with replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 09:30 and back on at 15:30, however the checks may take longer so please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. This work is taking place outside Little Paddock, 2 Iona, 4 Greenacre, 1 Nailbourne Close and Newbridge House.               |

Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 09:30 and back on at 15:30, however the checks may take longer so please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. This work is taking place outside Pullen Farm Cottage, Windmill Cottage and Windmill Lodge.                                  |

To enable us to work close to the high voltage overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work needs to take place for safety reasons, along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in the fields near Danny House. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.                                                                                                                    |

To enable us to work close to the overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work needs to take place for safety reasons, it will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on the land along the side of Broughton Park. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are adhering to government guidelines to keep our customers and colleagues safe.

The reason you're currently without power is a planned outage in the areas listed. We have turned off your electricity supply to allow us to safely carry out essential work to our electrical equipment. By doing this, it'll help us to improve the reliability of our service to you for the future. If you have any questions or require more information, please call us on 105 or send us a message on <a href="http://m.me/ssencommunity/">Facebook</a> or Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/ssencommunity">@ssencommunity</a>) with reference  '198551'.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 5:46am. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the extent of repairs required and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 12 noon. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
