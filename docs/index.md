It will be necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at Midnight due to a faulty piece of equipment on the overhead line network. Our team will be carrying out repair work safely on the overhead line network network and this may affect the supply to your property.

Engineers have managed to restore power to a number of properties and are continuing to work on the underground cable fault near Wauchope Avenue substation and we still expect all power to be restored by 2am. We understand that to be without power is frustrating and we apologise for this. We will update this message if this information changes. Thank you for your patience.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. This work is taking place on Trottiscliffe Road. Please note that we will be using two way traffic management on the day of the planned power cut. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. |

This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place off Rye Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                     |
