We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 5:58PM. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of the repairs required to an underground cable fault and our team are now working to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by Midnight. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

The transformer controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure the quality of supply in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place in the Tompsets Bank and Balfour Gardens area.

While the power is switched off our engineers are going to take the opportunity to replace two high voltage electricity poles that have come to end of their serviceable lives. Doing this work at the same time will hopefully minimise any disruption in the future, improve the reliability of the electricity network along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why its important to complete this work durimng the coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place at a site off Newick Hill and Fletching Mill.

They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place outside Thompsons Gareden Centre, Pengarth, Pear Tree Farm and Chequers Inn on Stone Street. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                        |
