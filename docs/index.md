We have worked to minimise the length of time that this work will affect your property. This work is following on from a customers request and due to the type of underground electricity cables we need to make the connection to, engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power to ensure they can carry out this work safely. This work will ensure that our electricity network can uphold the electricity usage in your area whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Aldershot Road in Guildford. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                             |

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 11:09 am. Our engineers have arrived on site to investigate an unconfirmed report of third party damage to our network. Our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible. We expect the power to be restored by  2:15 pm. We will update this message if this information changes.

Along with replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This work is taking place on Collier Street. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut.

Along with replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This work is taking place on Plumtree Road. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 10:00 and back on at 16:00, however the checks may take longer so please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the power cut. |

Along with replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This work is taking place outside Sea Ridge to outside Bramble Patch on The Length. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by this work and thank you for your patience.                                                                                                                                                      |

A third party has requested that UK Power Networks switch off the power to allow them to carry out tree trimming safely around our overhead electricity cables in the Boyes Lane area. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. Which is why we need to complete this during the coronavirus pandemic.

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. In order to connect and disconnect the generator we will need to temporarily switch off your power. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator as soon as possible so your power may come on sooner. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                                                  |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. In order to connect and disconnect the generator we will need to temporarily switch off your power. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.
