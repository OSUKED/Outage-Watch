Along with replacing and upgrading an overhead electricity cable with an improved insulated cable. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on High Street. Please note that two way traffic management will be used on the day. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                 |

This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Wardsbrook Road.

To enable us to work close to our low voltage overhead electricity cables and cut the trees safely our engineers will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work needs to take place for safety reasons, along with reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Main Street. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                               |
