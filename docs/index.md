Our emergency response team has managed to restore power to a number of properties, and we are working to restore power for those customers still off supply. Repairs are taking longer than expected because of a grounded overhead line and our team are now working to get the power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 3:00AM.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 9:02pm. Our engineers have established that there is an underground cable fault outside 17 Church Street and that repairs will be complex so we are awaiting delivery of generators to restore power, and this should happen by 1:30am.

We did not know in advance there would be a power cut, and are working to get supplies restored. So far we have managed to restore power to some customers and identified an underground cable fault affecting the rest of our customers. We have arranged additional resources to attend to assist in carrying out the repair and now expect your supply to be restored by 2:00am. We understand that being without power is frustrating and please be assured we will restore your supply as soon as we possibly can. If for any reason this information changes then we will update this message. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
