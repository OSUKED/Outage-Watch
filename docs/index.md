Our engineers are on their way to the area to investigate and our team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible. We expect the power to be restored by 6.15PM. Once they arrive, or when we receive any update regarding the cause, we will be able to provide you with more information. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

It will be necessary for our engineers to carry out an emergency shutdown at 4PM to safely continue emergency repairs. Our team will be carrying out repair work safely on the underground cable network and this may affect the supply to your property. We will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible, and we expect the power to be restored by 6.30PM. We will update this message if this information changes.

They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors erecting the new poles prior to the outage to the allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 09:30 and back on at 15:30, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. This work is taking place outside Messines to outside Marne on Upper Road. |

This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Kithurst Lane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
