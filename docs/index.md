Our next available engineer will attend site and the team will work to get your power back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 11pm.

Along with replacing and upgrading an overhead electricity cable with an improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Partridge Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                |

Along with replacing and upgrading an overhead electricity cable with an improved insulated cable. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place on High Street. Please note that two way traffic management will be used on the day. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                               |

This equipment controls and delivers the electricity into your area. These are essential works that will improve the reliability of the electricity network, ensure our network can uphold the amount of electricity in your area and will also reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place off Sissinghurst Road. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                                                                       |
