The reason you're currently without power is a planned outage in the areas listed. We have turned off your electricity supply to allow us to safely carry out essential work to our electrical equipment. By doing this, it'll help us to improve the reliability of our service to you for the future. If you have any questions or require more information, please call us on 105 or send us a message on <a href="http://m.me/ssencommunity/">Facebook</a> or Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/ssencommunity">@ssencommunity</a>) with reference  '199175'.

We had no advance warning of this and only became aware of it at 6:11am. Our team has managed to restore power to a number of properties in the area and are still working to repair a fault on our underground cable network affecting the rest of our customers without power. We now expect all power to be back on as quickly and as safely as possible by 6pm. We will update this message if this information changes. We apologise for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
