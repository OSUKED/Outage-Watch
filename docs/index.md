Along with replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of the electricity network and will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut which is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. This work is taking place in and around Little Mongeham. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                                                                      |
