This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Coldrum Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                              |

This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Mill Lane. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category.                                 |
