When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network.
