They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors completing preparation works prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption. Due to safety reasons our contractors need to complete a safety check with your internal equipment checking a plug and a socket on separate circuits to enable the power to be turned on and off. Due to these checks being manual we aim to turn the power off at 10:00 and back on at 16:00, however please allow extra time for the checks to be completed. Access will only be required before and after the planned power cut. This work is taking place on Holmesdale Hill."
