This propertys Cut-Out needs replacing due to potential safety concerns. When we identify properties with this issue we often identify further properties requiring the same works to be completed. Therefore we would like to access your property during the power cut to inspect the equipment within your property and to replace if necessary. Once the inspections and replacements have been completed this will ensure that all properties are safely connected to our electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Buxton Crescent and Carlton Crescent. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category"
