Our engineers turned off the power to 10 properties in stages between 08:09 and 08:23 to allow them safely replace some overhead electricity poles and the replacement of the transformer that feeds power into your area. They have advised us that the works have progressed well and as a result will be restored early at approx. 15:15 to all 10 properties. Now these works have been completed this will improve the reliability of the electricity network whilst also reducing the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-229454-Z.  We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
