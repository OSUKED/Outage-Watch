They will also be replacing and upgrading some overhead electricity cables with improved insulated cables. This will improve the reliability of our electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus pandemic. You may see our contractors erecting the new poles prior to the outage to allow for a shorter interruption on the day of the planned power cut. Please note a road closure will be in place on the day of the works. This work is taking place within Barfreston from Church Farm up to Cannon Cottage. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category."
