When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this work during the Coronavirus outbreak. This work is taking place at a property on Mill Lane in Ashford. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category."
