A third party has requested that UK Power Networks switch off the power to allow them to carry out tree trimming safely around our overhead electricity cables in the Boyes Lane area. This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. Which is why we need to complete this during the coronavirus pandemic. The government has given exemptions to certain industries and activities, this outage falls into this category."
