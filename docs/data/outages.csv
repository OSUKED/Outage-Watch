This work is following on from a customer's request and to ensure engineers can carry out this work safely will need to temporarily switch off your power. This work will ensure the electricity network can uphold the amount of electricity required for the area. During this time you will be connected to a generator to provide you electricity whilst we carry out our essential works. We aim to connect and disconnect the generator within 15 minutes so your power may come on sooner. This work is taking place in the Woodhill Lane area.

This work will ensure that the trees are trimmed to their satisfaction and are not close to our overhead electricity cables. When the third party has completed their works our engineers will be able to restore power. This will also reduce the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network. This is why it is important to complete this during the Coronavirus pandemic. This work is taking place on Kithurst Lane.
